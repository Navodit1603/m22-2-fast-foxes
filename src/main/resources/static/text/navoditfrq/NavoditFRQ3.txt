Question 1

Assume that the following variables have been properly declared and initialized.

a boolean variable named rsvp
an int variable named selection, where 1 represents "beef", 2 represents "chicken", 3 represents "pasta", and all other values represent "fish"
a String variable named option1
a String variable named option2

(a)   Write a code segment that prints "attending" if rsvp is true and prints "not attending" otherwise.

    if(rsvp){
        System.out.println("attending");
        }
    else{
        System.out.println("not attending");
        }

(b)   Write a code segment that prints the food item associated with selection. For example, if selection is 3, the code segment should print "pasta".

    switch(selection){
        case 1:
            System.out.println("beef");
            break;

        case 2:
            System.out.println("chicken");
            break;

        case 3:
            System.out.println("pasta");
            break;

        default:
            System.out.println("fish")
            break;

(c)   Write a code segment that will store a dinner selection in option1 based on the values of rsvp and selection. The intended behavior of the code segment is described below.

If rsvp is true, the code segment should store in option1 a string indicating the personâ€™s attendance and food choice. For example, if rsvp is true and selection is 1, the following string should be stored in option1.

"Thanks for attending. You will be served beef."

If rsvp is false, the following string should be stored in option1, regardless of the value of selection.

"Sorry you can't make it."


   if(rsvp){
   System.out.println("attending");
    }
   else{
        System.out.println("not attending");
        }


(d)   Write a code segment that will print true if the strings option1 and option2 contain the same values and will print false otherwise.


    if(option1 == option2){
        return True;
        }
    else{
        return False;
    }


Question 2

(a) public class Draw {

    public void drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {

    public void drawSquare(int x, int y, int len) {
    int xsum = x + len; int ydiff = y - len;
    if (xsum > 10) xsum = 10 - x; if (ydiff < 0) ydiff = 0 - y;
    if ((x - xsum) > (y - ydiff)) xsum = ydiff+x-y;
    else ydiff = xsum+y-x;

    drawLine(x, y, x, ydiff);
    drawLine(x, y, xsum, y);
    drawLine(x, ydiff, xsum, ydiff);
    drawLine(xsum, y, xsum, ydiff);
    	}

    int side = xsum - x;
    System.out.println("side length = " + side + ", area = " + Math.pow(side, 2));
    }
    }
